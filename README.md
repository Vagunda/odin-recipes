# odin-recipes
This project is the first assignment of "The Odin Project" curriculum.
 
1. I familiarized myself with navigating, creating files and directories with the use of the terminal.
2. Learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate and the importance of creating readable code with indentations.
3. Learned how to input headers, paragraphs, images and links, ordered and unordered lists.
